my notes here...
what classes i need to have
.
.
.
api class : since it deals with api i will only apis i will have all my api data parsed here and then take the data back to th cli class
cli class:  this class deals with user, so i will created it to make sure i have connected my user to the program and api 
actor class: in this class i will welcome the user, then give them the option to proceed the program. once user choose to
             stay in the program then i will have him/her to see all the data from star war api, once they are in their
            i will ask them if they want to play more and know more about the actors they like, if they choose to stay, i will have them
            choose whether they want to stay in the program for more actors. this will on up until stop or exit from the program.
